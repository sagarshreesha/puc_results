# Results Portal for Govt. PUC Students
This is a web portal for PU students to check their results. This website was actually deployed and was used by over 5000 students to check their results. This was built in collaboration with the **Government of Karnataka, PU Education Board.** 
During the lockdown colleges were asked not to display results in the college where students gathered. So I was asked to build a web portal for students to check their results online. This was deployed on Heroku and had over 5000 users from the Ballari District where it was used.
This was built using **Vue.js**, **MongoDB** , **GraphQL** and **Node JS**.

# Why Vue.js ?

I had recently started with Framework Oriented Web Development. I had previously used Angular and React. However, the requirement for this project was that it had to be built in very less time, that is in a span of just 2 days. I had learnt Vue freshly and knew that it was easy and more straightforward which enabled me to build this website quickly. So that's why I preferred Vue. It worked out perfectly and had no issues with the development and deployment process whatsoever.
